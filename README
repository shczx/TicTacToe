This is a simple project implementing the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
The project is intended to help myself review the concepts of polymorphism and exception.

The usage info is as follows:
The user will first be prompted to enter the mode of each player (A means AI, H means Human),
the name of each player (human player only) and the points required to win the game (positive int only).
Human player needs to enter the position they want to mark on the board. The position needs to be formatted as [row][space][col], e.g. 0 1.
If human player enters a valid position (not marked yet and within the scope of the board), they will be asked if they want to end their turn.
If human player enters 'y', their turn ends. If they enters 'n', they will be prompted to enter a position again.


Rows and columns on the board are described as follows:
 0 1 2
0 | | 
 - - -
1 | | 
 - - -
2 | |
